         It was on my 12th birthday when I first realized this weird thing happening to me since the day one of my life.It made my life like a hell & I was hating it but it kept happening to me all the time which I couldn't control.Until that night of my birthday I was totally hating it.But when I realized I was completely shocked.
        <br> 
        <br>

 

  I knew I had a unique ability which no one possessed.But I didn't know what that was or how did I get that on me.When I was born my mother died because of that ability.The doctor's report was that she died because of internal bleeding on her head.But how on earth it would happen because of giving birth.So they were shocked & after further investigation they found out that the moment before I was born something quickly & powerful flashed through her brain which damaged her brain & after internal bleeding of sometime she died.They said it happened so quickly that they couldn't do anything to save her or figure out what damaged her brain.It was like beyond their knowledge.Since then I didn't have any mother's love like everyone does.Also my father hated me for what I did knowingly or unknowingly.So that's why I was hating it.
<br> 
<br>

   

  I was raised in a house where an old woman & a girl were the same age as me lived.My dad left me here after that incident happened with my mother giving birth of me.The old woman raised me like her daughter Hannah & I also considered her as my living mother although she told me to call her Nanny.She was a neighbour of my father & mother.Like I could see my father's house,see when my father going out of the house but I wasn't allowed to talk or meet with my father.Nanny said,
<br> 

'Your father dared me to stay you out of him.Or else he will do something really bad to you.'
<br> 

As I was a kid back then I feared of my father.So I always looked through the window to my father's house if he would ever notice me or might just forgive me or meet with me.But that day never came back then.
<br> 
<br>

 

  I also never did actually met or talk with nanny's daughter Hannah.Like I could see her going to school but couldn't actually talk with her.My nanny always kept me out of her.But why she was doing it I didn't know.I always wondered maybe she knew what was happening to me or why can't I be allowed to talk with somebody.Maybe she knew what is inside my body & my mind.I always wondered that but never actually asked her cause I didn't have that courage.She was very kind & loveable but her way of looking was very scary.I barely talked with her unless it was necessary.So I was planning for a long time of how I could ask her about that weird thing.I tried to ask her three or four times but always failed.I was frustrated.I lost hope & I was lying on my bed at midnight hoping I could find another way looking at the moon through the window.I was hoping will I ever be free or live a happy life normal life like others.I slept thinking of that.
<br>
<br> 

 

  The next day I woke up hearing my nanny's yelling from downstairs,
<br> 

'Ryan!Ryan!wake up my boy.It's 11am already & you still sleeping.you listening?Ryan?'
<br>  

'Yeah,I am listening nanny.Just a little bit more.'
<br>  

'Ok don't take too long.Listen,I am going out for a while.Your breakfast is in the kitchen.Eat it quickly or it will get cold.I am going now.'
<br>  

'Ok nanny bye.'
<br> 

After that I woke up,freshed up & went to the kitchen downstairs.I saw the food was completely hot.But nanny did said the food was getting cold.Anyways I didn't care that much & I started eating.Then all of a sudden I heard a scream.It was a bit loud.I thought scream came from outside.But then again  I heard the scream again.Then I had a little fear.I stood up & started walking towards where the scream coming from.It was coming from a room beside my nanny's room.I never actually went to nanny's room.So I was hesitating.But the scream becoming more loud and loud when I walked towards the room.After I came to the door of the house,the scream stopped.Like everything went silent.I was standing still fearing what could be inside that room.I was sweating & shaking.Then I slowly opened the door & I saw everything dark & soundless.I could see some lights which was coming through a small broken glass of the window of the room.Then I stepped into the room & stood still again,looking everywhere in that room.Then I heard something from the corner & was giving light sounds.I quickly ran outside the room & hide behind a cabinet outside the room & I saw two rats coming out of the door.It was like a big relief of what these two rats gave me like a ghost fear.I quickly went back to my room,grabbed a torchlight & went to that room again.There were nothing on that except a wardrobe & big mirror.It really seemed like a ghost room.I looked at the mirror & saw myself staring at me with that torch.I was sweating so hard that my entire body got wet.Then I went closer to the wardrobe.It was in a corner of the room.I took a long breath & then I forwarded my hand towards the handle of the wardrobe.As soon as I touched that I heard a very loud scream which I couldn't bear.I dropped my torch light & quickly blocked my ears with my hands.I couldn't bear the sound of the scream so I sat on floor.I was hearing a woman's scream & a man's talking.
<br> 

'No,No,please please,spare my son.I beg you.Please!He doesn't know anything about it.Please I beg you.He is innocent.'
<br>  

'Oh yeah.I know he is innocent.Then tell me how can you be so sure that he will not become like you?Huh tell me!tell me now or else die.' 
<br> 

'Nooooooooooo'
<br>  

after that I saw my eye becoming blurry & dark & I was lying on the floor.I looked in the door & saw someone standing at the door.
